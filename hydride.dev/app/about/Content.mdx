Hydride is a diverse team of developers, system administrators, artists, and UI designers. We come from all corners of the planet, with various backgrounds and a vast array of experiences. One thing's for certain, though: <GradientBold>we love building things, and we love having fun doing it.</GradientBold>

## We build everything. And more.
Given our team's wide range of specialties, we offer a <b className={yellowGradientText}>variety of services</b> to our clients. However, the vast majority of our work is focused between <b>designing web applications</b> and <b>managing cloud infrastructure</b> (systems administration).

Whether it be a simple e-commerce website for your new business, full-fledged cloud infrastructure solutions for your new taco startup, or anything in between, <b className={yellowGradientText}>we've got you covered</b>.

## Not just for the dolla-dolla.
Alongside the usual day-to-day freelance work that we do, sometimes we decide to build something; sometimes, it's for ourselves, but other times, we just build things because we feel like it's cool and unique! 

We've built a few things over the past couple of years - most notably, our flagship file host, [hydride.space](https://new.hydride.space) (currently in an invite-only alpha stage). Regardless of what we build, we strive to make it the <b className={yellowGradientText}>highest grade</b> of quality possible.
